Using rust rataui create a ui for cli a sidebar and a main view -

1. the sidebar should have a list of git commits - you can use up and down arrows to see git commit lists

2. the main will show a diff preview - using a syntax highlighter package to show react code and highlight the diff if its added or removed code using red and green bg line colors.

I am using these packages - they are the latest versions of those packages - don't change version just google search the creates version details as you many times just use previous version so don't do that - use the version that I already have - they are already latest version so don't use previous versions of these packages - do google search if needed to know about the latest versions details
