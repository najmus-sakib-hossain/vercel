Issues for icon sets are welcome.

## Limitations

Not all icon sets are accepted.

There are many thousands of icons available, but that does not mean they are useful. 
Iconify is not a collection of random SVG files.

Requirements for icon sets:
- Only open source icon sets are accepted.
- Icons must be usable in UI elements, such as buttons and navigation. High detailed illustrations are not accepted.
- Icon set must be usable. Random stuff, such as car logos and icons specific to your website, do not belong here.

Additionally, the following restrictions apply to most icon sets, but exceptions can be considered on case by case basis:
- Icons with hardcoded palette are rarely accepted because of their limited use. Icons designed for specific apps, such as desktop themes, are not really usable and therefore not accepted.
- Icon sets are automatically kept up to date. In order to keep icon sets up to date, SVG files must be easily available where download can be automated. See below.

If you are not sure if an icon set can be added, just open an issue.

### Sources

In order to keep icon sets up to date, icon sets must be available wherever it is possible to automate download.

Examples:
- Git repositories
- Figma files (can be accessed with API)
- NPM packages

Downloading icons from a website is not an option.

## Consistent UI

While requirements listed above might seem to be strict, they are there for a reason.

When developer creates a UI, icons should have the same layout. If they don't, website looks ugly.

It is preferrable to have icon sets with large choice of consistently designed icons.

## Why not all SVGs are accepted?

There are many thousands of badly designed icons that are not wanted. 
All those icons do, is make it harder to find good usable icons.

If you just want to find one specific icon, do not care if it is a part of set, there are plenty of websites out there that collect all possible SVGs from the internet. 
Iconify project is not one of them.
