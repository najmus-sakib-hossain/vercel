## Motivation

I use terminal emulator almost every day. I stare at it so much. I need some
entertainment in terminal, so I found [`ponysay`][ponysay] which is beautiful
and giving my terminal some colors. But `ponysay` kind of bloated for me since
I don't display all those ponies.

So, I want to make my own minimal tool to make my terminal so colorful and
display the character that I like. This chance is a great time to learn `rust`.
This project is mainly for me to learn rust and hopefully I get some feedback
while this make us all happy üòÅ.

## Installation

### AUR

For Arch Linux, package available via AUR. Example install this with AUR helper:

```console
yay -S charasay
```

or

```console
yay -S charasay-bin
```

### Cargo

If you have `rustup` or `cargo`, this tool available on crates.io. Install this with:

```console
cargo install charasay
```

### Manual

Just donwload from the [release page](https://github.com/latipun7/charasay/releases)
for your compatible Operating System, then extract the zip archive, give permission
to execute on extracted file, then place it on your `PATH`.

Alternatively, clone this repository, then build this with `cargo build --release`.

### Prerequisites

To display characters, your terminal needs to support true color (24-bit color).
Unicode fonts are needed to render the border of speech bubble.

## Usage

### Display Default Character to Say Something

Run `chara say something that motivating.` It would display colorful cow saying
`something that motivating.`.

If message is empty, it would accept from standard input, piping would works:
`fortune | chara say`.

### Display Different Character

Run `chara say -f ferris "Hello rustaceans!"`.

It could display external `.chara` files: `chara say -f ~/path/test.chara "Nice"`.

> Note: `.chara` files could be generated from PNG file.
>
> I want to implement this builtin in this tool. For now, you could generate
> `.cow` file with [Cowsay file converter][cowsay-converter] then rename `.cow`
> into `.chara`.

### Shell Completions

Shell completions also available with `chara completions` which would print out
completions script to standard output. Please consult to your shell documentation
on how to add completions.
