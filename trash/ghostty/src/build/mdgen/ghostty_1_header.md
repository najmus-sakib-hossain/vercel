# NAME

**ghostty** - Ghostty terminal emulator

# DESCRIPTION

Ghostty is a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that aims to push
the boundaries of what is possible with a terminal emulator by exposing modern,
opt-in features that enable CLI tool developers to build more feature rich,
interactive applications.

There are a number of excellent terminal emulator options that exist today.
The unique goal of Ghostty is to have a platform for experimenting with modern,
optional, non-standards-compliant features to enhance the capabilities of CLI
applications. We aim to be the best in this category, and competitive in the
rest.

While aiming for this ambitious goal, Ghostty is a fully standards compliant
terminal emulator that aims to remain compatible with all existing shells and
software. You can use this as a drop-in replacement for your existing terminal
emulator.
